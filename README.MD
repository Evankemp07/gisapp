# Overview

This application shows how a react frontend can be used to serve a responsive and simple web app. This web app also used the dajango framework to create create an api.

This application was made to provide visitors of my Christmas light show with other light shows to visit that are near by. The user will simple visit the website and they can explore the map. The user can utilized the markers that are automatically populated to the map from a postgresql database. 

I created this software to provide my light show visitors with as much info about other close by light shows in a simple and easy format.
